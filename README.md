# Bikesharing

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to create visualizations using Tableau in order to create a proposal for how a bikeshare program would work in Des Moines, Iowa. The visualizations will be based on citibike data gathered in New York City, New York. This project consists of 7 visualizations and a story that depicts how a bikeshare program would operate in Des Moines, Iowa. 

### Results
This visualization shows that out of the 2,344,224 rides in August in New York City, the vast majority of rides were less than one hour long.

### Summary 

In Des Moines, a ridesharing program will look similar to that in New York, however there may be discrensies between some data such as ride duration due to the diffence in city size and population. 
In Des Moines, it is likely that the majority of rides will continue to be rented by men, and the most popular times to rent will be between 6am and 10am, and 5pm and 7pm during the week. On weekends, rides will be split more evenly throughout the day. Men will also likely make up a greater proportion of subscribers than women. 

I would create three new visualizations. The first would show the diffence between New York and Des Moines populations. The second visualization would show the difference between ages. The third would show the differences in city size. These three visualizations would help to more accurately predict what the size of the consumer base in Des Moines will be.
